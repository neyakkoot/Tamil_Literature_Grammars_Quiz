# 📘 Tamil Grammar History

> A comprehensive, research-oriented repository documenting the evolution of Tamil grammar from classical works to modern computational frameworks.

This project aims to bridge the gap between traditional grammatical treatises like *Tolkappiyam*, *Nannool*, *Viracholiyam*, and *Balavyakaranam*, and contemporary Comparative Linguistics and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## 🔎 Contents Planned

This repository will serve as a central hub for the following resources:

* **⏳ Historical Timeline:** A detailed documentation of the chronological evolution of Tamil grammatical texts.
* **📜 Manuscript References:** Critical editions, archival data, and manuscript references.
* **🔗 Comparative Grammar:** In-depth syntactic and morphological comparison across Dravidian languages (Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam) and Sanskrit.
* **🧠 Metatheory:** Structural analyses and theoretical frameworks of Tamil grammar.
* **💻 Tamil NLP Datasets:**
    * *PiRappiyal* (Articulatory Phonetics) structured data.
    * Word classification schemes and tagging models.
